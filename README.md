Optera Game Engine, Second Edition

OPT SE is the second iteration of the original 2D-Game-Engine app that I built here on GitHub. The main change between the first edition and the second edition is the addition of keystroke detecting.

Originally used with the game FlabbyManuel, Optera Game Engine is based off of the concepts found in the StdDraw class developed by the Princeton University Department of Computer Science.

Todo List:
 - Make an actual game with the engine!
 - Add in detectability for all keys
 - Add the ability to draw generic circles & rectangles
 - Make the screen resizeable to 1080p, 480p, etc
 - Build an app that acts as a testing platform with various functions
